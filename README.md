## DatasetHelper

This module has a function to speed up asynchronous tasks requiring a lot of input data (e.g downloading a (very large) dataset from a list of URLs). Any data preprocessing/transformation should be done separately from the coroutine passed into the "run_threads" function.

*Hamburger not included.*
